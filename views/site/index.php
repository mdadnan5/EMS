                <p>Editors in good standing in the community can request extra user rights, granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions.
                    By 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years,
                    in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous.

                    where majority of Wikipedia's servers are located. 
                     Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines.</p>
